Overview
--------

catSurv provides methods of computerized adaptive testing for survey researchers with functions to calculate the probability of a respondent providing an item option with `probability()`, a current estimate of their position on a latent trait with `estimateTheta()`, and ultimately selecting the next best survey item to adminster to that respondent with `selectItem()`, among others.
